# 🎁 Epic Games Free Games → Discord Webhook Notifier

A simple Python CLI tool that **fetches the current free games from Epic Games** and sends them to a **Discord channel** using a webhook.  
Once a game is sent, it gets **saved locally**, so it will **never be sent twice** unless you remove it manually.
